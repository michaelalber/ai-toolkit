description: Manages the full Alembic migration lifecycle with safety checks and rollback planning. Python analog of ef-migration-manager. Use when creating, reviewing, or applying database migrations in Python projects using SQLAlchemy and Alembic. Triggers on phrases like "alembic migration", "create migration", "apply migration python", "database migration python", "sqlalchemy migration", "alembic revision", "alembic upgrade", "alembic downgrade".

# Alembic Migration Manager

> "Every migration is a one-way door. Make sure you know what's on the other side. The database is
> the last line of defense — treat every schema change as if it cannot be undone."

## Core Philosophy

Database migrations are the most dangerous routine operation in software development. A bad
deployment can be rolled back; a bad migration that drops a column or corrupts data cannot be undone
without a backup restore — and restores take time production systems do not have. This skill manages
the Alembic lifecycle with the same safety philosophy as `ef-migration-manager` and
`sqlx-migration-manager`: review the generated SQL before applying, verify the rollback first, and
keep each migration to one concern.

**Non-Negotiable Constraints:**
1. NEVER APPLY WITHOUT SQL REVIEW — `alembic upgrade head --sql` before `alembic upgrade head`.
2. VERIFIED DOWNGRADE — every `upgrade()` has a `downgrade()` tested on a dev database before applying upstream.
3. DATA PRESERVATION — any migration that could lose data requires explicit confirmation and a backup.
4. ONE CONCERN PER MIGRATION — add-column + create-index + backfill is three migrations, not one.
5. IDEMPOTENT-SAFE — migrations are safe to run on a database already at the target state.

Full principle table, KB lookups, command sequences, anti-patterns, discipline rules, and error
recovery live in `references/conventions.md`.

## Workflow

```
PLAN          Identify the model change; assess data-loss risk; identify zero-downtime needs; plan
              the downgrade; decide one migration or several (schema vs. data backfill).
              Run: alembic current · alembic history · alembic check (must be clean).

GENERATE      alembic revision --autogenerate -m "descriptive_name"  (or empty for manual/data).
              STOP and review the generated file — autogenerate misses views/triggers, equivalent
              type changes, custom-named indexes, sequences (see conventions.md).

REVIEW SQL    alembic upgrade head --sql  AND  alembic downgrade -1 --sql. Verify: matches intent,
              no unexpected DROP/data loss, acceptable locks. (Lock detail: dangerous-operations.md.)

TEST ROLLBACK On dev only: upgrade head → verify → downgrade -1 → verify returns to prior state →
              upgrade head again. (Checklists: migration-safety-checklist.md.)

APPLY         alembic upgrade head → alembic current to confirm. Roll back with downgrade -1 if needed.
```

**Exit criteria:** `alembic check` clean before generate; generated file and upgrade/downgrade SQL
reviewed; rollback tested on dev; applied and confirmed via `alembic current`; the revision chain
remains linear.

## State Block

```
<alembic-migration-state>
phase: PLAN | GENERATE | REVIEW_SQL | TEST_ROLLBACK | APPLY | COMPLETE
migration_name: [descriptive name]
data_loss_risk: none | low | medium | high
zero_downtime_required: true | false
sql_reviewed: true | false
rollback_tested: true | false
current_revision: [revision ID or "head"]
target_revision: [revision ID or "head"]
last_action: [description]
next_action: [description]
</alembic-migration-state>
```

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| `python-feature-slice` | When a feature needs schema changes, use this skill for the migration lifecycle. |
| `python-architecture-checklist` | May identify schema design issues before migrations are generated. |
| `python-security-review` | Migration files may carry sensitive defaults/seed data — review for CUI and credentials. |
| `ef-migration-manager` / `sqlx-migration-manager` | Cross-references for .NET and Rust stacks — identical safety philosophy, different tooling. |
