  QRASPI Architecture phase -- lock the path-dependent decisions for a NEW system as MADR ADRs
  with alternatives, draw the C4 Context + Container in Mermaid, and specify the required fitness
  functions. Use for "/qraspi-architecture <project>", "write the ADRs for new X", "what
  architecture for new X", "C4 for new system X", "lock the stack decisions for X". This is where
  the picks happen, behind ADRs the human aligns on. Do NOT use to review or critique an EXISTING
  system's architecture (use architecture-review). Do NOT use for retrospective ADR journaling
  (use architecture-journal). Do NOT use to design a feature in an existing codebase (use
  qrspi-spec). Do NOT use for the deprecated RPI workflow.

# QRASPI Architecture

> "Architecture represents the significant decisions, where significance is measured by cost of change."
> -- Adapted from Grady Booch

## Core Philosophy

The Architecture phase is where greenfield finally **chooses**. Research mapped the landscape and
refused to pick; Architecture locks the path-dependent decisions -- the ones expensive to reverse
once code exists -- as **MADR ADRs with real alternatives**, then makes each decision *executable* by
specifying the fitness function that will gate it in CI. The failure mode this phase prevents is the
**fait-accompli ADR**: a record that rationalizes a decision already made instead of weighing options
the human can redirect. So every ADR carries >= 2 considered options, is written `proposed`,
presented, and set `accepted` only after the human aligns -- the greenfield analog of `qrspi-spec`'s
"brain surgery" gate. An ADR that names a measurable quality attribute without a fitness function is
an intention with no teeth; this phase requires both. For high-domain-complexity systems an optional
pre-step invokes `domain-model` (no 7th phase -- it folds in here).

**Non-Negotiable Constraints:**
1. RESEARCH-GATED -- never start without `research.md` (status: complete) on disk; never design from
   memory. The ADR alternatives come from research's "Options on the table".
2. ADRs WITH ALTERNATIVES -- every ADR is MADR format with >= 2 Considered Options; a fait-accompli
   ADR (< 2 real options) cannot reach WRITE
3. ALIGN BEFORE LOCK -- write ADRs `status: proposed`, STOP and present, loop on the human's
   redirection; set `status: accepted` only after approval (`adrs_aligned: true`)
4. FITNESS FUNCTIONS REQUIRED -- every accepted ADR naming a measurable quality attribute gets
   >= 1 specified fitness function; `fitness_functions_specified` MUST be > 0 (authoring delegates
   to the `fitness-functions` primitive, which lands them as CI gates in Skeleton)
5. CONTEXT BUDGET: keep utilization under 40%. At 60%, write `architecture.md` with progress and
   tell the user to start a fresh session.

## Workflow

```
PRE-FLIGHT
    [ ] Locate the project folder thoughts/shared/qraspi/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}/
    [ ] Read research.md (status: complete). If absent -> STOP; route the user to /qraspi-research
    [ ] Read the answered questions.md for quality attributes + hard constraints
    [ ] OPTIONAL: high domain complexity? -> invoke domain-model -> CONTEXT.md the ADRs reference
    [ ] Determine adr_dir: default <target-repo>/docs/adr/ (overridable via --adr-dir / frontmatter)

DRAFT  (decisions as PROPOSED ADRs)
    For each path-dependent decision behind research's "Options on the table":
      write a MADR ADR (references/adr-template.md), NNNN-kebab-title.md, >= 2 Considered Options,
      status: proposed
    Draft architecture.md: summary + C4 Context & Container in Mermaid (references/c4-conventions.md)
      + a fitness-function spec index (references/fitness-spec.md)

ALIGN & LOOP  (the "brain surgery" gate -- mirrors qrspi-spec)
    Present the proposed ADR set + C4. STOP. The human redirects -> revise -> re-present.
    Loop until approved. Only THEN set each ADR status: accepted; adrs_aligned: true.

FITNESS SPEC  (required output)
    For every accepted ADR naming a measurable quality attribute, specify >= 1 fitness function in
    architecture.md (references/fitness-spec.md): attribute, threshold, candidate tool, ADR id.
    Authoring/wiring is the fitness-functions primitive's job in Skeleton; this writes the contract.
    fitness_functions_specified > 0.

WRITE
    <target>/docs/adr/NNNN-*.md   (accepted ADRs -- live in the target repo, QRSPI reads them later)
    thoughts/shared/qraspi/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}/architecture.md   (status: complete; INDEXES the ADRs)

REPORT
    architecture.md path · accepted ADR list · C4 levels drawn · fitness functions specified ·
    "Review, then start a NEW session and run /qraspi-skeleton"
```

**Exit criteria:** every ADR is MADR format with >= 2 alternatives and `status: accepted`;
`adrs_aligned: true`; C4 Context + Container drawn in Mermaid; `architecture.md` written and indexes
the accepted ADRs; `fitness_functions_specified > 0`; user told to review before `/qraspi-skeleton`.

## State Block

```
<qraspi-architecture-state>
phase: PRE-FLIGHT | DRAFT | ALIGN-LOOP | FITNESS-SPEC | WRITE | REPORT | COMPLETE
project_folder: thoughts/shared/qraspi/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}/
adr_dir: [target]/docs/adr/
research_present: true | false          # MUST be true to proceed
domain_model_invoked: true | false      # optional -- high domain complexity only
adrs_drafted: [count]
adrs_min_alternatives_met: true | false # every ADR has >= 2 Considered Options
adrs_aligned: true | false              # MUST be true before any ADR is set accepted
c4_levels: [Context, Container]
fitness_functions_specified: [count]    # MUST be > 0 to COMPLETE

</qraspi-architecture-state>
```

## Output Template

See `references/adr-template.md` for the MADR ADR structure (Considered Options required),
`references/c4-conventions.md` for the Mermaid `C4Context`/`C4Container` conventions and the
`architecture.md` summary shape, and `references/fitness-spec.md` for the fitness-function spec table
that hands off to the `fitness-functions` primitive.

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| `qraspi-research` | Prior phase. Its `research.md` "Options on the table" are the alternatives input for the ADRs. |
| `qraspi-skeleton` | Next phase. Consumes `architecture.md` + the accepted ADRs; lands the specified fitness functions as CI gates. |
| `fitness-functions` | Authors the fitness functions this phase specifies (it owns the per-stack tooling); Skeleton wires them as CI gates. |
| `domain-model` | Optional pre-step for high domain complexity -- produces a `CONTEXT.md` the ADRs reference. No 7th phase. |
| `architecture-journal` | Reusable ADR + retrospective skill; this phase uses a MADR variant (`references/adr-template.md`) for the greenfield decision lock. |
| `qrspi-spec` | Brownfield sibling's design gate. Architecture is the greenfield analog -- ADRs-with-alternatives instead of a design brain-dump. |
