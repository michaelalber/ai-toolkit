## Core Philosophy

This skill scaffolds and maintains Minimal API endpoints in .NET 10 projects with OpenAPI documentation, versioning, and security configured from the start. Every API begins with a clear contract, validated inputs, and documented responses.

**Non-Negotiable Constraints:**

1. **OpenAPI-First Design** — Every endpoint must have OpenAPI metadata: name, summary, request/response types, and status codes. No endpoint ships without `.WithName()`, `.WithSummary()`, and `.Produces<T>()`.
2. **Versioning from Day One** — API versioning is configured at project creation, not retrofitted. Every endpoint group includes a version segment. There is no "we'll add versioning later."
3. **Security by Default** — Groups default to `.RequireAuthorization()`. Anonymous access is an explicit opt-in via `.AllowAnonymous()`, never an implicit default.
4. **Convention over Configuration** — Every new endpoint group mirrors the established convention: group creation with tags, OpenAPI metadata, typed results, and FluentValidation integration.
5. **Typed Results, Not Raw Responses** — All handlers return `TypedResults` with explicit union return types (`Results<Ok<T>, NotFound, ValidationProblem>`). No raw `IResult`, no untyped `Results.Ok()`, no status code magic numbers.

## Domain Principles Table

| # | Principle | Description | Priority |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | **Endpoint Grouping** | Related endpoints are organized into static extension method classes (e.g., `UsersEndpoints`). Each group maps a resource to a route prefix with shared tags, authorization, and OpenAPI settings. | Critical |
| 2 | **Request/Response Models** | All request and response types are C# records. Request models use `[AsParameters]` for GET queries. No anonymous objects, no `dynamic`, no `Dictionary<string, object>`. | Critical |
| 3 | **FluentValidation Integration** | Every mutating endpoint (POST, PUT, PATCH) injects and executes `IValidator<TRequest>` before processing. Validation is explicit in the handler, not hidden in middleware. | Critical |
| 4 | **OpenAPI Documentation** | Every endpoint declares `.WithName()`, `.WithSummary()`, `.Produces<T>()` for all possible status codes, and `.Accepts<T>()` for request bodies. | Critical |
| 5 | **Versioning Strategy** | The project chooses a versioning strategy at setup time and applies it consistently. URL versioning (`/api/v{version:apiVersion}/`) is the recommended default. | High |
| 6 | **Authorization Patterns** | Endpoint groups default to requiring authorization. Individual endpoints may override with specific policies or `.AllowAnonymous()`. Policies are defined in `Program.cs`. | Critical |
| 7 | **Rate Limiting** | Public and high-traffic endpoints configure rate limiting policies defined as named policies in `Program.cs` and applied with `.RequireRateLimiting()`. | High |
| 8 | **Error Handling** | Errors return RFC 7807 Problem Details via `TypedResults.Problem()` or `TypedResults.ValidationProblem()`. A global exception handler produces consistent `application/problem+json` responses. | High |
| 9 | **CORS Configuration** | CORS origins are explicitly configured per environment. Never use `AllowAnyOrigin()` in production. Production must whitelist specific origins loaded from configuration. | High |
| 10 | **Health Checks** | Every API project includes health check endpoints (`/health`, `/health/ready`, `/health/live`) mapped with `.AllowAnonymous()`. Database connectivity is included in readiness checks. | Medium |

## Knowledge Base Lookups

| Query | When to Call |
|-------|--------------|
| `search_knowledge("ASP.NET Core Minimal API endpoint group TypedResults .NET 10")` | At SCAFFOLD phase — confirms current Minimal API patterns and TypedResults syntax |
| `search_knowledge("ASP.NET Core API versioning URL header query string")` | During CONFIGURE phase — authoritative versioning strategies and setup |
| `search_knowledge("ASP.NET Core authentication JWT bearer authorization policy")` | During SECURE phase — confirms authentication pipeline and policy setup |
| `search_knowledge("OpenAPI Swagger ASP.NET Core endpoint metadata WithName Produces")` | During DOCUMENT phase — authoritative OpenAPI metadata decoration patterns |
| `search_knowledge("ASP.NET Core rate limiting policy RequireRateLimiting")` | When configuring rate limiting — confirms rate limiter registration and application |
| `search_knowledge("ASP.NET Core health checks ready live endpoints")` | When scaffolding health checks — confirms health check endpoint patterns |

Search before each scaffold phase. Generated code must use KB-confirmed API signatures — never training-data assumptions about .NET versioned APIs. Cite source paths in generated file headers.

## Workflow

The scaffold lifecycle flows: **CONFIGURE → SCAFFOLD → SECURE → DOCUMENT**. Each phase has a verification checklist before advancing to the next.

### Phase 1: CONFIGURE

Set up the project foundation before any endpoints are created.

- [ ] Create or verify `.csproj` with required packages (see `references/endpoint-patterns.md`)
- [ ] Configure `Program.cs` with service registrations: OpenAPI, versioning, FreeMediator, FluentValidation, DbContext
- [ ] Set up authentication and authorization pipeline
- [ ] Configure API versioning strategy (URL recommended)
- [ ] Register rate limiting policies
- [ ] Configure CORS for target environments

### Phase 2: SCAFFOLD

Create endpoint groups, request/response models, and validators.

- [ ] Create endpoint group static class with extension method pattern
- [ ] Define all CRUD operations with typed results
- [ ] Create request records for each mutating operation
- [ ] Create response DTOs for each query operation
- [ ] Implement FluentValidation validators for all request models
- [ ] Wire endpoint group into `Program.cs` via `api.Map{Resource}Endpoints()`

### Phase 3: SECURE

Apply authorization, rate limiting, and CORS to all endpoints.

- [ ] Apply `.RequireAuthorization()` to endpoint groups
- [ ] Define and apply specific policies for sensitive operations
- [ ] Apply rate limiting to public-facing or high-traffic endpoints
- [ ] Verify CORS is configured for all consuming origins
- [ ] Add health check endpoints with anonymous access
- [ ] Verify authentication middleware is in the pipeline

### Phase 4: DOCUMENT

Ensure every endpoint is fully documented via OpenAPI metadata.

- [ ] Verify every endpoint has `.WithName()` and `.WithSummary()`
- [ ] Verify every endpoint declares all `.Produces<T>()` responses
- [ ] Add `.WithDescription()` for complex endpoints
- [ ] Test Swagger UI renders correctly for all versions
- [ ] Verify versioned Swagger docs are accessible
- [ ] Confirm request/response schemas appear in OpenAPI spec

## AI Discipline Rules

**Always add FluentValidation to mutating endpoints.** Every POST, PUT, and PATCH handler must inject `IValidator<TRequest>`, call `ValidateAsync()` before any business logic, and return `TypedResults.ValidationProblem(validation.ToDictionary())` on failure. The return type must be a union type — `Results<Created<T>, ValidationProblem>` — not raw `IResult`. Never rely on model binding validation alone.

**Never create endpoints without OpenAPI metadata.** Every endpoint must have `.WithName("OperationId")`, `.WithSummary("brief description")`, `.Produces<T>(statusCode)` for every possible response, and `.Accepts<T>()` for request bodies. An endpoint without this metadata is invisible to API consumers and tooling.

**Always configure CORS explicitly per environment.** Never use `AllowAnyOrigin()` outside development. Origins must be loaded from configuration, not hardcoded. Apply CORS in the middleware pipeline before authentication. Allow credentials only when specific origins are listed.

**Use TypedResults with union return types.** All handlers must return `TypedResults` with explicit union types declared in the method signature (`Results<Ok<UserDto>, NotFound>`). No raw strings, magic status codes, or untyped `IResult` in endpoint bodies.

**Enforce structural versioning and one group per resource.** Version segments must appear in the route template — use `app.NewVersionedApi()` with `.HasApiVersion()` on groups. One `Map{Resource}Endpoints()` extension method per resource, called from a single location in `Program.cs`. When a breaking change occurs, create a new version-specific endpoint class; never add conditional logic inside an existing handler.

## Anti-Patterns Table

| # | Anti-Pattern | Problem | Correct Approach |
|---|-------------|---------|------------------|
| 1 | **Fat Program.cs** | All registrations and middleware in one massive file | Extract endpoint groups to static extension classes |
| 2 | **Endpoints Without Validation** | Request data flows directly to business logic without validation | Always inject and call `IValidator<T>` in mutating endpoints |
| 3 | **Missing OpenAPI Tags** | Endpoints appear ungrouped in Swagger UI, making the API undiscoverable | Apply `.WithTags()` at group level, `.WithName()`/`.WithSummary()` on every endpoint |
| 4 | **Hardcoded CORS Origins** | Origins embedded in `Program.cs` cannot change per environment | Load origins from `appsettings.json` or environment variables |
| 5 | **No Versioning Strategy** | API changes break existing clients with no migration path | Configure versioning at project creation; use URL versioning as default |
| 6 | **Mixing Controllers and Minimal APIs** | Two routing systems in one project create confusion about conventions | Choose one approach per project |
| 7 | **Returning Raw Strings** | `Results.Ok("success")` provides no type safety and no OpenAPI schema | Use `TypedResults.Ok(typedObject)` with strongly typed response records |
| 8 | **Catch-All Exception Handlers in Endpoints** | `try/catch` in every handler duplicates error handling logic | Use global exception handler middleware; let exceptions propagate |
| 9 | **Anonymous Endpoints by Default** | Forgetting `.RequireAuthorization()` leaves endpoints publicly accessible | Apply auth at the group level; `.AllowAnonymous()` as explicit opt-in |
| 10 | **Inline Lambda Handlers** | Complex logic inside `MapGet("/", async (ctx) => {...})` is untestable | Extract handlers to named static methods; inject dependencies as parameters |

## Error Recovery

**Project already has controllers**: Do NOT convert existing controllers in place. Create a `Features/` directory alongside existing `Controllers/`. Configure both `app.MapControllers()` and minimal API groups in `Program.cs`. Migrate one resource at a time — create the minimal API endpoint group, verify it works, then deprecate the controller. Ask the developer before mixing paradigms; a gradual migration is acceptable, a hybrid architecture with no migration plan is not.

**Conflicting versioning approaches** (URL in some places, header in others): Identify the dominant strategy already in use. Configure `ApiVersionReader.Combine()` to support existing clients during migration. Standardize all new endpoints on URL versioning. Document the canonical approach. Never remove a working version reader without a client migration plan.

**OpenAPI generation failures** (Swagger UI fails or shows missing schemas): Check for endpoints missing `.Produces<T>()` — Swashbuckle cannot infer response types from minimal APIs. Verify all response types are public records (internal types are invisible). Check for duplicate `.WithName()` values (operation IDs must be unique). Inspect `/swagger/v1/swagger.json` directly for schema errors. Verify `app.UseSwagger()` and `app.UseSwaggerUI()` are in the correct pipeline order.

**Rate limiting not taking effect**: Verify `app.UseRateLimiter()` is in the pipeline after routing and before auth. Confirm rate limiter policy names match the names used in `.RequireRateLimiting("PolicyName")`. Test under load with `bombardier` or `hey`. Verify the `OnRejected` handler returns 429 responses.
