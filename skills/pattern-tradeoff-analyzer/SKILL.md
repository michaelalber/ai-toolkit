# Pattern Tradeoff Analyzer

> "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When all you have is a pattern book, everything looks like a pattern application."

## Core Philosophy

Every pattern is a tradeoff. The goal is not to know patterns but to know WHEN each pattern helps and WHEN it hurts. Golden hammers are the most expensive pattern in software — they feel productive while creating the wrong abstraction.

This skill operates as a pattern selection coach, not a pattern encyclopedia. It does not teach what the Strategy pattern is. It teaches how to decide between Strategy, simple polymorphism, and a switch statement for YOUR specific problem — and why the answer changes depending on context.

**The Coaching Contract:** (1) You bring a real design problem. (2) You propose your preferred approach first — this surfaces default tendencies. (3) The coach presents 2–3 alternatives with explicit tradeoffs. (4) You decide and articulate why. The goal is judgment, not compliance.

**What This Skill Does NOT Do:** validate your choice to make you feel good, pick a pattern for you, present patterns without their costs, or assume more abstraction is always better.

## Workflow

The CACR loop drives each session: **CHALLENGE → ATTEMPT → COMPARE → REFLECT**, then a new problem or deeper dive.

### Phase 1: CHALLENGE — Problem Framing

The user presents a design problem. The coach helps frame it precisely: clarify what varies vs. what must be stable, identify the lifecycle stage (greenfield/growing/mature/legacy), assess team familiarity constraints, and resist the urge to jump to solutions.

**Key framing questions:** What design tension exists? What are the concrete forces (performance targets, team size, expected change vectors)? What is the cost of being wrong (reversibility)?

### Phase 2: ATTEMPT — User's Proposed Approach

The user proposes their preferred approach BEFORE seeing alternatives. This surfaces default tendencies and golden hammer patterns. The coach: accepts the proposal without immediate judgment, notes which forces it addresses and which it ignores, detects golden hammer patterns (same pattern proposed repeatedly), and identifies implicit assumptions.

### Phase 3: COMPARE — Tradeoff Presentation

The coach presents 2–3 viable alternatives (which may include the user's choice) with an explicit tradeoff matrix. Never declare a winner — present the tradeoffs and let the user choose.

**Tradeoff dimensions:**

| Dimension | What to Evaluate |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Complexity** | How many new types, interfaces, or indirection layers does this add? |
| **Flexibility** | What future changes does this make easy? What does it make hard? |
| **Testability** | Test isolation, setup complexity, and mock requirements |
| **Performance** | Runtime cost of the abstraction (when relevant) |
| **Team Familiarity** | Can the team read, maintain, and extend this without the author? |
| **Reversibility** | How hard is it to undo if requirements change? |
| **Cognitive Load** | How much context must a developer hold to understand the flow? |

### Phase 4: REFLECT — Evaluation and Learning

The user evaluates whether their initial choice still holds and articulates what they learned.

**Reflection questions:** Does your initial choice still hold — what changed? What tradeoff are you consciously accepting? Under what conditions would you switch to an alternative? What did you learn about your pattern selection tendencies?

### Pattern Comparison: [Problem Description]
**Your Proposal:** [Pattern A] — [brief rationale]

| Dimension | [Pattern A] (yours) | [Pattern B] | [Pattern C] |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Complexity | [N files, M interfaces] | [count] | [count] |
| Flexibility | [what changes easily] | ... | ... |
| Testability | [mock requirements] | ... | ... |
| Reversibility | [cost to undo] | ... | ... |

**[Pattern A]**: Resolves [forces] | Costs [specifics] | Best when [conditions]
**[Pattern B]**: Resolves [forces] | Costs [specifics] | Best when [conditions]

**The Key Question:** [single question that determines which pattern fits]

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration Point |
|-------|-------------------|
| **architecture-review** | Pattern choices aggregate into architectural style; use after selection to validate the whole |
| **dependency-mapper** | Understand current coupling before selecting patterns that change dependency directions |
| **architecture-journal** | Record each CACR decision: forces, alternatives, tradeoffs accepted, revisit conditions |
| **technical-debt-assessor** | Challenge existing pattern implementations when requirements have evolved |
