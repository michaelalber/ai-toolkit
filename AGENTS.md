# AI Toolkit — Project Context
<!-- ⚠ PROJECT-LEVEL FILE — NOT GLOBAL
     This is the project-level AGENTS.md for OpenCode.
     It supplements your global opencode/global/AGENTS.md — it does NOT replace it.
     Global standards (coding style, security rules, quality gates) live in the global file.
     This file contains only what is specific to THIS repository.

     DISCIPLINE 2: Context Engineering — scoped to this project.
     Tells the agent everything it needs to KNOW about this repo.

## Project Overview

- **Name:** AI Toolkit
- **Purpose:** A collection of 88 shareable skills and autonomous agents for AI-assisted software development. Supports Claude Code, OpenCode, and Pi. Edge AI, ML, robotics, and industrial-automation skills live in the companion `edge-ai-robotics-automation-toolkit`.
- **Phase:** Maintain — stable toolkit; work consists of adding new skills/agents, fixing existing ones, and keeping platform parity.
- **Jira project key:** N/A — task specs are tracked in conversation context or ad hoc
- **Definition of success:** Every skill and agent installs cleanly, follows its template (skills: the 5-section lean layout; agents: the agent section template), and works out of the box without requiring external documentation.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Content format:** Markdown + YAML frontmatter — no compiled language, no build system
- **Agent platforms:** Claude Code (claude.ai/code), OpenCode, and Pi (pi.dev / Ollama local models)
- **Global install targets:** `~/.claude/` (Claude Code), `~/.config/opencode/` (OpenCode), `~/.pi/agent/` (Pi)
- **Package manager:** None for skills/agents; `bun` used in `opencode/global/` for OpenCode config dependencies

---

## Architecture

- **Pattern:** Flat directories by domain — skills, agents, global config, and project templates are siblings, not layers
- **Two-level context stack:**
  - `claude/global/CLAUDE.md` + `opencode/global/AGENTS.md` + `pi/global/AGENTS.md` — universal standards, installed once globally
  - `CLAUDE.md` (root) + `AGENTS.md` (root) — this repo's context only
- **Key directories:**
  - `skills/{team,professional}/<name>/` — skill definition (`SKILL.md`) + supporting docs (`references/`); the `team`/`professional` subdirectory is selected by the skill's `audience:` frontmatter
  - `claude/agents/` — Claude Code agent definitions (`.md` with `skills:` frontmatter array)
  - `opencode/agents/` — OpenCode agent definitions (`.md` with boolean tool flags + `skill()` body calls)
  - `claude/commands/` — Claude Code user-invoked slash commands with shell injection
  - `opencode/commands/` — OpenCode command equivalents with agent routing and subtask isolation
  - `claude/global/` — global Claude Code files installed to `~/.claude/`
  - `claude/global/settings.json` — hooks: PreToolUse credential stop, PostToolUse build/lint gates
  - `opencode/global/` — global OpenCode files installed to `~/.config/opencode/`
  - `pi/global/` — global Pi files installed to `~/.pi/agent/`; `SYSTEM.md` is a per-project template
  - `project-templates/` — context file templates users copy into their own project roots
- **Non-obvious constraints:** `claude/global/`, `opencode/global/`, and `pi/global/` files affect every project on the user's machine — changes require explicit human approval before committing

## Persistent Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-03-01 | 10-section template for skills and agents | Enforces completeness; gold standard is `skills/professional/architecture-review/SKILL.md` |
| 2026-03-01 | Claude Code uses `skills:` frontmatter array; OpenCode uses `skill()` body calls | Platform format requirements differ; behavior must be identical |
| 2026-04-18 | Specs live in Jira / Confluence, not local `spec.md` | Professional dev workflow; `spec.md` creates stale duplicates |
| 2026-04-18 | `project-templates/` renamed from `templates/` | "project-templates" makes the scope explicit — these are not global files |
| 2026-04-18 | Global files live in `claude/global/` and `opencode/global/` | Separates global standards from project-level context; aligns with install script targets |
| 2026-04-24 | Pi global files live in `pi/global/`; AGENTS.md installs to `~/.pi/agent/`; SYSTEM.md is a per-project template | Pi's `SYSTEM.md` is project-scoped (not a global config file); keeping it in `pi/global/` as a user-copyable template matches Pi's per-project design |
| 2026-04-24 | Commands layer added alongside agents | Commands are user-invoked (typed as `/command-name`); skills are model-invoked (autonomous). Different primitives, same platform directory scope. |
| 2026-04-24 | Hooks in `settings.json`, permissions in `settings.local.json` | Separation of concerns — deterministic enforcement (hooks) vs. interactive approval (permissions). Keep in separate files. |
| 2026-04-25 | Two-tier skill system: minimal (≤ 100 lines, ≥ 1 reference) and full-template (10 sections, ≤ 400 lines, ≥ 2 references) | Ported from mattpocock/skills — minimal tier handles mode switches, conversational tools, and single-instruction skills without the overhead of the 10-section template. |
| 2026-04-25 | `disable-model-invocation: true` frontmatter for interactive/conversational skills | Ported from mattpocock/skills — prevents auto-invocation by the model; grill-me, domain-model, zoom-out use this. |
| 2026-04-26 | Global template files (`claude/global/`, `opencode/global/`) must contain only generic, domain-level descriptions — no specific book titles, personal document names, or user-specific tool references | These files are public templates installable by any user. Personal enrichment belongs in the installed copies (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`), not the repo source. |
| 2026-06-02 | QRSPI replaces RPI: deprecate the 4 rpi-* skills + `rpi-planner`/`rpi-implement` agents now (`disable-model-invocation: true` on skills + `DEPRECATED` description prefix); remove all rpi-* files at sunset ~2026-09-01 (Slice 7). The 3 read-only subagents were renamed `research-*` (workflow-neutral) and kept. | RPI delivered poor results (instruction-budget overflow, magic-words dependency, plan-reading illusion). Coexistence leaves the poor-outcome path discoverable; QRSPI is its replacement, so RPI is deprecated then removed. |
| 2026-06-02 | QRSPI vendors **0 new primitive skills** — `qrspi-implement` references the existing `tdd` skill as its inner loop; `qrspi-spec`/`qrspi-plan` carry the vertical-slice gate in their own content; all five cross-link `tdd` and the `*-feature-slice` scaffolders via Integration | `tdd` already IS the canonical RED-GREEN-REFACTOR loop purpose-built as a shared inner loop; a new `red-green-refactor` skill would be ~100% duplication. Honors DRY and the "Companion Skills" non-overlap doctrine. |
| 2026-06-02 | Minimal-tier definition broadened to include **thin, self-sufficient workflow-phase drivers (≤ ~40 imperative directives)**. All five `qrspi-*` phase skills use the minimal tier (≤ 100 lines, ≥ 1 reference), self-sufficient when invoked directly, overflow pushed to `references/` loaded just-in-time | QRSPI exists because prompts past ~150–200 instructions degrade; the full 10-section template reproduces the exact bloat QRSPI was created to fix, and is worst on smaller local models. Every section is an always-on per-invocation token tax. |
| 2026-06-02 | QRSPI artifacts co-locate in a per-feature folder `thoughts/shared/qrspi/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}/` (`questions.md`, `research.md`, `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `implementation/slice-NN-*.md`) rather than scattering across `thoughts/shared/research|plans/` | QRSPI produces five tightly-coupled artifacts per feature; co-locating them makes a fresh session cheap (read the folder, not the transcript) and gives each slice log a clean resumption point. `spec.md`/`plan.md` carry a lifecycle `status:` (the `approved` gate blocks `qrspi-implement`). |
| 2026-06-03 | QRASPI greenfield workflow added: six phases Q→R→A→S→P→I + a terminal graduation handoff, the greenfield (V0/V1) counterpart to QRSPI. **2-agent topology split by edit access**: `qraspi-orchestrator` (no-Edit: Questions/Research/Architecture/Plan/Graduate) + `qraspi-builder` (Edit: Skeleton/Implement). | Greenfield's edit boundary differs from QRSPI's (Skeleton and Implement write source; Q/R/A/P/graduate are markdown), but it still splits cleanly into who-may-edit. A 3rd agent buys nothing — Skeleton and Implement share tools and the green-gate philosophy. QRASPI maps a problem domain; QRSPI maps an existing codebase. |
| 2026-06-03 | QRASPI extracts **one** new primitive skill, `fitness-functions` — the first new primitive since the QRSPI "vendored 0 primitives" decision. ADR-writing, C4, and walking-skeleton scaffolding were instead **folded** into the phase skills + `references/`. | `fitness-functions` has ≥2 callers (`qraspi-architecture` specifies them, `qraspi-skeleton` lands them as CI gates) and cross-workflow reuse (a brownfield QRSPI feature can add a CI-gate fitness function); no existing skill covers the surface (`dependency-mapper` covers only the coupling-metric category). The doctrine holds in spirit: extract only at ≥2 callers with no existing cover. |
| 2026-06-03 | QRASPI artifacts co-locate per project in `thoughts/shared/qraspi/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}/` with **per-slice** `plan-{slice}.md` + `implementation-log-{slice}.md` (vs QRSPI's single `plan.md` + `implementation/slice-NN-*.md`); accepted ADRs live in the **target repo's** `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md`. | Greenfield grows slice-by-slice on the skeleton, so Plan/Implement run once per slice (default: the next unbuilt backlog slice from `skeleton.md`). ADRs are project artifacts QRSPI later reads, so they belong in the repo, not the qraspi feature folder. |
| 2026-06-03 | QRASPI ADRs use the **MADR** template (Title/Status/Context/Considered Options/Decision/Consequences) with **≥2 alternatives required** and an align-before-lock gate (proposed → human aligns → accepted). | "Alternatives Considered" is a MADR/Tyree addition, not original Nygard; QRASPI requires alternatives so a fait-accompli ADR cannot reach WRITE, and MADR carries them natively. `architecture-journal` keeps its own ADR variant; QRASPI's MADR template lives in `qraspi-architecture/references/adr-template.md`. |
| 2026-06-03 | QRASPI C4 diagrams use **Mermaid** `C4Context`/`C4Container` (Context + Container levels only). | The repo is markdown-native with no build system; Mermaid renders inline in GitHub/Codeberg/VS Code, is diffable, and is AI-generatable. Structurizr DSL is richer but needs tooling the repo lacks. |
| 2026-06-03 | QRASPI Skeleton's exit gate is **CI green** — a real CI/test run (build + unit + lint + fitness gates) exiting 0, captured as `ci_green`, never a claim. Hardware archetypes: host gates green + device-deploy as a documented manual gate. | A walking skeleton is executable by definition; an aspirational scaffold defeats the phase. The fitness functions `qraspi-architecture` specified are wired by `fitness-functions` and must pass as part of CI green; `qraspi-implement` keeps them green per slice. |
| 2026-06-03 | Deprecate `spec-implement` alongside RPI (`disable-model-invocation: true` + `DEPRECATED` description prefix; removal at sunset ~2026-09-01). Its `rpi-*` pointers in `spec-implement`, `tdd`, and `spec-coach` were scrubbed to QRSPI/QRASPI. | `spec-implement` was branded "the greenfield counterpart to RPI" and routed to the now-deprecated `/rpi-research` in five places; QRASPI (greenfield) and QRSPI (brownfield) subsume its spec → criteria → per-slice TDD flow with artifact-gated phases. Leaving it live keeps a stale path to a sunset workflow discoverable. |
| 2026-06-03 | Cross-language **architecture + security parity** for .NET/Python/PHP/Rust. Architecture: four `<lang>-architecture-checklist` skills sharing an identical Core Values + `DETECT→SCAN→REPORT(A–F)→RECOMMEND` workflow + output, differing only in language checks/tooling; `python-arch-review` (a misfit TDD-authoring hybrid) renamed/re-scoped to `python-architecture-checklist`; `php-architecture-checklist` created. Security: four `<lang>-security-review` bases share an OWASP core; **gov collapses to ONE language-agnostic `security-review-federal` overlay** (NIST 800-53 · CUI · DOE · POA&M · EO 14028 + per-language FIPS table), replacing `dotnet-security-review-federal` + `python-security-review-federal`. All trimmed lean; depth in `references/`. | User wants the four languages "in sync" (same workflow/values, language-specific specifics) and lean. Per-language skills (not one detecting skill) preserve trigger routing and match every other family. The federal overlay is ~80% language-agnostic policy, so one shared skill gives gov parity for all four languages at once and one place to keep NIST/CUI/POA&M in sync — far leaner than duplicating it 4×. `python-arch-review` was the lone misfit whose triggers collided with `tdd`/`python-feature-slice`/`python-security-review`. |
| 2026-06-03 | **React skill family** added (first frontend family), mirroring the .NET/Python/PHP/Rust families: `react-architecture-checklist`, `react-security-review`, `react-feature-slice`, `react-component-scaffolder`, `react-app-scaffolder`, `react-modernization-analyzer` (6 skills) + 6 agents in both runtimes (`react-feature-slice-agent`, `react-component-scaffold-agent`, `react-app-scaffold-agent`, `react-security-agent`, `react-modernization-agent`, `react-arch-checklist-agent`). React is a frontend library, so two backend archetypes were **remapped**: the HTTP `api-scaffolder` slot → `react-component-scaffolder` + `react-app-scaffolder` (the component/app is the front-end "unit"), and the DB `migration-manager` slot → `react-modernization-analyzer` (class→hooks, CRA→Vite, 17→18→19, JS→TS); the `*-package-scaffold` (npm) archetype was **dropped** to keep the family at the standard 6 skills. Federal overlay gained a React/TS FIPS row; `security-review` command dispatch adds `react`. | User asked for React "to mirror the php, python, etc." The remapping keeps the family the same size and shape while respecting that a frontend library has no HTTP endpoint or DB migration. **Grounding gap noted:** the KB has no React corpus (`grounded_javascript` is JS/TS + Vue, not React), so every React skill grounds TS via `collection="javascript"`, a11y via `collection="ui_ux"`, OWASP via `collection="internal"`, and cites **react.dev** as the primary authority. Follow-up (separate repo): add a `grounded_react` collection to grounded-code-mcp. |
| 2026-06-03 | Consolidate the TDD cluster 8→5. **Delete** `tdd-implementer` and `tdd-refactor` — their per-phase content folds into the canonical `tdd` skill's GREEN/REFACTOR sections + `references/` (green idioms, `code-smells`, `refactoring-catalog`, loaded on demand). **Merge** `tdd-verify` into `evaluate-tests` as a second "TDD compliance" mode (commit-history scorecard + AI anti-patterns). **Keep** `tdd` (the one loop), `tdd-agent` + `tdd-pair` (operating modes that defer to `tdd`), `evaluate-tests`, `test-scaffold`. Agents `tdd-agent`/`test-generation-agent` updated; no agent/command count change. | Eight overlapping TDD skills created an unanswerable routing question ("for GREEN, use `tdd` or `tdd-implementer`?"). The per-phase skills re-derived single phases of the loop `tdd` already owned whole, and the two auditors (`tdd-verify`, `evaluate-tests`) overlapped. One loop + modes + one auditor is focused and token-efficient; depth moved to load-on-demand `references/`. TDD/RGR is critical to AI-agent coding — clarity of "which skill" matters most here. |
| 2026-06-03 | **Full-template tier adopts the 5-section lean layout**, retiring the "10 Mandatory Sections" standard. SKILL.md keeps only Title+Epigraph · Core Philosophy (with a Non-Negotiable Constraints list) · Workflow · State Block · Output Template (pointers) · Integration. The four heavy sections — Domain Principles table, AI Discipline (WRONG/RIGHT), Anti-Patterns table, Error Recovery — plus all code/report templates move to `references/`, loaded just-in-time. Size budget drops 400 → 200 lines. Gold standard moves from `architecture-review` (10-section) to `qraspi-skeleton` + `cargo-package-scaffold`. Rollout migrates the heaviest full-template skills first (Tier A); pilot `cargo-package-scaffold` went 367 → 103 lines with zero information loss. | The 10-section template "reproduces the exact bloat QRSPI was created to fix" (2026-06-02 decision): every always-loaded section is a per-invocation token tax, worst on smaller local models. The qraspi/qrspi family proved the 5-section shape in production. Depth is preserved (relocated, not deleted) and stays discoverable via mandatory pointers in SKILL.md, so trigger reliability and authority are unaffected while the always-on token cost drops ~60–70%. |
| 2026-06-19 | **RPI sunset executed early (Slice 7, originally scheduled ~2026-09-01).** Deleted the 4 `rpi-*` skill dirs + `spec-implement`, and the `rpi-planner`/`rpi-implement` agents in both runtimes; scrubbed all live `rpi-*` references from README, `pi/SKILLS-local.md`, `docs/`, and the `qrspi-*`/`session-context`/`spec-coach` skills. Counts: skills 103→98, agents 49/49→47/47, commands unchanged. The 3 read-only `research-*` subagents stay. | Both workflows were already deprecated (`disable-model-invocation: true` + `DEPRECATED` prefix); pulling the sunset forward removes the dead path now instead of carrying it to September. QRSPI (brownfield) + QRASPI (greenfield) fully subsume RPI and `spec-implement`. Historical `thoughts/` logs left intact as records. |
| 2026-06-20 | **Quality prune: dropped 8 skills + 2 paired agents.** Removed the device-specific edge/IoT/robotics cluster — `picar-x-behavior`, `jetson-deploy`, `sensor-integration`, `edge-cv-pipeline`, `fleet-management`, `anomaly-detection` (professional) — plus `caveman` (communication-mode gimmick, Pocock port) and `tdd-pair` (over-segmented third TDD variant; `tdd` + `tdd-agent` cover the loop + autonomous mode). Deleted paired agents `sensor-anomaly-agent` + `fleet-deployment-agent` in both runtimes; scrubbed README (badges, stats table, prose, suite tables, tree), `pi/SKILLS-local.md`, and `.matt-pocock-attribution.yml` (caveman entry). Counts: skills 98→90 (team 80→78, professional 18→12), agents 47/47→45/45, commands unchanged. Kept `model-optimization` + `model-optimization-agent` (quantization/ONNX is reusable beyond edge) and `ollama-model-workflow` (general local-LLM). | Toolkit targets general software teams; the hardware cluster requires specific boards (Jetson/Picar-X/SBC sensors) and delivers no value without that hardware. `caveman`/`tdd-pair` were thin/redundant. QRASPI/QRSPI retained in full — actively used. |
| 2026-06-25 | **`tools/` houses standalone utilities** — runnable programs that are not skills, agents, or commands. First entry: `tools/pdf2md/` (Python CLI, PDF → RAG-ready Markdown), self-contained with its own `pyproject.toml`, tests, and `README.md`. These do not count toward skill/agent/command tallies and are excluded from platform-parity checks. | The toolkit's three primitives (skills/agents/commands) are prompt artifacts; a PDF converter is executable code with its own dependency graph and test suite, so it does not belong under `skills/`. A dedicated `tools/` directory keeps executable utilities discoverable without polluting the primitive counts or the Claude/OpenCode parity invariant. |
| 2026-06-20 | **Spun out the edge-AI/robotics/automation supplement repo.** Created `edge-ai-robotics-automation-toolkit` (sibling repo) for Local AI, Edge AI, ML, Robotics, and Industrial Automation. Moved the remaining AI/edge skills out of ai-toolkit into it: `model-optimization` (+ `model-optimization-agent`, both runtimes), `ollama-model-workflow`, `rag-pipeline-python`, `rag-pipeline-dotnet`, `mcp-server-scaffold`. These join the 6 edge skills (`picar-x-behavior`, `jetson-deploy`, `sensor-integration`, `edge-cv-pipeline`, `fleet-management`, `anomaly-detection`) + 2 agents (`sensor-anomaly-agent`, `fleet-deployment-agent`) pruned earlier the same day — all now live in the supplement. Scrubbed README (badges, stats, AI/ML Bridge Suite, professional agent section, tree, prose), `pi/SKILLS-local.md`, and skill Integration cross-refs. The supplement does **not** duplicate global config — it layers on ai-toolkit. Counts: skills 90→85 (team 78→74, professional 12→11), agents 45/45→44/44, commands unchanged. | This earlier-kept cluster ("reusable beyond edge") is, in practice, the AI/ML/local-inference domain the new toolkit is built to own. Consolidating all AI/edge/robotics/automation skills in one supplement gives a clean two-repo portfolio split: ai-toolkit = general software engineering; the supplement = the physical/edge/AI stack. Single-homed skills, no duplication. |

## Open Loops

- [ ] Skill count (currently 88) — update this file and README when skills are added or removed. `oss-vetting` added 2026-06-25 (was 87 → 88): federal OSS/SBOM vetting assessment skill (team), with paired `oss-vetting-agent` in both runtimes (agents 44/44 → 45/45) and `/oss-vetting` command in both runtimes (commands 24/24 → 25/25). PARA knowledge-management pair added 2026-06-20 (was 85 → 87): `para-file` + `para-review` (team), each with `/para-file` + `/para-review` commands in both runtimes (commands 22 → 24); no agents. Edge supplement spin-out 2026-06-20 moved 5 more out (was 90 → 85): `model-optimization`, `ollama-model-workflow`, `rag-pipeline-python`, `rag-pipeline-dotnet`, `mcp-server-scaffold` → `edge-ai-robotics-automation-toolkit`. Quality prune 2026-06-20 dropped 8 (was 98 → 90): the edge/IoT/robotics cluster (`picar-x-behavior`, `jetson-deploy`, `sensor-integration`, `edge-cv-pipeline`, `fleet-management`, `anomaly-detection`) + `caveman` + `tdd-pair`. `dotnet-controller-api-scaffolder` added 2026-06-03 (was 102 → 103): controller-based Web API scaffolder that conforms to existing conventions; skill-only, no agent/command (matches the .NET family convention — `minimal-api-scaffolder` et al. have no agents). Same change made `dotnet-architecture-checklist` style-aware (layered/N-tier controller branch via `references/layered-ntier.md`) — no count change. QRSPI added 5 phase skills 2026-06-02 (was 81); QRASPI added 8 (`fitness-functions` + the 7 phase/graduate skills) 2026-06-03 (was 86, → 94); TDD cluster consolidated 8→5 on 2026-06-03 (→ 91); cross-language architecture+security parity 2026-06-03 (renamed `python-arch-review`→`python-architecture-checklist`; +`php-architecture-checklist`, +`php-security-review`, +`security-review-federal`; −`dotnet-security-review-federal`, −`python-security-review-federal` → 92); PHP family parity 2026-06-03 (+`php-feature-slice`, +`php-api-scaffolder`, +`php-package-scaffold`, +`php-migration-manager` → 96); React family parity 2026-06-03 (+`react-architecture-checklist`, +`react-security-review`, +`react-feature-slice`, +`react-component-scaffolder`, +`react-app-scaffolder`, +`react-modernization-analyzer` → 102 → 103 with `dotnet-controller-api-scaffolder`); RPI sunset 2026-06-19 removed the 4 `rpi-*` skills + `spec-implement` (→ 98).
- [x] Agent count parity — Claude Code (45) vs. OpenCode (45) — `oss-vetting-agent` added in both runtimes 2026-06-25 (was 44/44 → 45/45); edge supplement spin-out 2026-06-20 moved `model-optimization-agent` to `edge-ai-robotics-automation-toolkit` in both runtimes (was 45/45 → 44/44); quality prune 2026-06-20 removed `sensor-anomaly-agent` + `fleet-deployment-agent` in both runtimes (was 47/47 → 45/45); QRSPI added `qrspi-orchestrator` + `qrspi-implement` 2026-06-02 (was 35/35, resolved 2026-05-19); QRASPI added `qraspi-orchestrator` + `qraspi-builder` 2026-06-03 (was 37/37); PHP family parity 2026-06-03 added `php-feature-slice-agent`, `php-api-scaffold-agent`, `php-package-agent`, `php-migration-agent` in both runtimes (was 39/39, → 43/43); React family parity 2026-06-03 added `react-feature-slice-agent`, `react-component-scaffold-agent`, `react-app-scaffold-agent`, `react-security-agent`, `react-modernization-agent`, `react-arch-checklist-agent` in both runtimes (was 43/43, → 49/49); RPI sunset 2026-06-19 removed `rpi-planner`/`rpi-implement` in both runtimes (→ 47/47).
- [x] Commands layer — `claude/commands/` (25 commands) and `opencode/commands/` (25 commands) — `/oss-vetting` added in both runtimes 2026-06-25 (was 24/24 → 25/25) — PARA pair added `/para-file` + `/para-review` 2026-06-20 (was 22/22) — QRSPI added 5 (`/qrspi-questions`…`/qrspi-implement`) 2026-06-02 (was 10/10); QRASPI added 7 (`/qraspi-questions`…`/qraspi-graduate`) 2026-06-03 (was 15/15). No `rpi-*` commands, so sunset leaves commands at 22.

## Project Boot Ritual

Follow the global Session Boot Ritual (see global `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`). Repo-specific deltas:
read this file plus `intent.md` and `constraints.md`, and confirm the **Persistent Decisions** and
**Open Loops** below before starting. Tooling (grounded-code-mcp, Microsoft Learn MCP, grounding
workflow) is defined globally — not repeated here.

---

## Skill Conventions

Each skill lives in `skills/team/<name>/` or `skills/professional/<name>/` with a `SKILL.md` and a
`references/` directory. The `team` vs. `professional` subdirectory is selected by the `audience:`
frontmatter field and applied by `scripts/add_frontmatter.py` (which walks `skills/{team,professional}/*/`).

### SKILL.md Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
audience: team  # team | professional — selects the skills/<audience>/ install subdirectory
description: >
  What the skill does. Trigger phrases like "keyword1", "keyword2".

### Skill Tiers

| Tier | When to use | SKILL.md size | References required |
|------|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Minimal** | Mode switches, conversational tools, single-instruction skills, thin workflow-phase drivers (≤ ~40 imperative directives) | ≤ 100 lines | ≥ 1 file |
| **Full-template** | Domain-expert skills with workflow, state tracking, and output templates | ≤ 200 lines (depth → `references/`) | ≥ 2 files |

Minimal-tier skills have no prescribed section structure — just focused instructions.
Full-template skills follow the **5-section lean layout** below. Every always-loaded section is a
per-invocation token tax, so depth — principle tables, anti-patterns, discipline rules, recovery
steps, and code/report templates — lives in `references/` and loads just-in-time, not in SKILL.md.

### Description Format

The description field is the **only thing the model sees when deciding which skill to load**. Quality here determines trigger reliability.

- Max 1024 chars
- Third person: "Scaffolds...", "Audits...", "Extracts..." — not "I will..." or "You can..."
- First sentence: what the skill does
- Second sentence: "Use when [specific trigger scenarios]"
- Include "Do NOT use when..." for negative triggers

**Good:**
```yaml
description: >
  Scaffolds NuGet package metadata, CI/CD pipeline, and test harness.
  Use when publishing a new library to NuGet.org. Do NOT use for
  internal workspace-only libraries; use dotnet-vertical-slice instead.
```

**Bad (too vague — triggers on everything):**
```yaml
description: >
  A comprehensive and powerful tool for NuGet package management.
  Very useful for .NET developers.
```

### 5-Section Lean Layout (in order)

A full-template SKILL.md carries only what the model needs to *act*. Everything else is depth that
loads on demand from `references/`.

1. **Title + Epigraph** -- `# Skill Name` with 1 relevant quote
2. **Core Philosophy** -- design rationale + a numbered **Non-Negotiable Constraints** list. The
   Critical/High principles live here as constraints; the full principle table goes to `references/`.
3. **Workflow** -- phased lifecycle (e.g., DETECT, SCAN, REPORT, RECOMMEND) in one compact block,
   with exit criteria. Decision trees and long step prose go to `references/`.
4. **State Block** -- unique XML tag (e.g., `<tdd-state>`, `<arch-review-state>`) for multi-turn tracking
5. **Output Template** -- **pointers** to the report/code templates in `references/`, not the
   templates inline
6. **Integration with Other Skills** -- a table cross-referencing related skills

**Pushed to `references/` (depth, loaded just-in-time):** the full Domain Principles table,
Anti-Patterns table, AI Discipline (WRONG/RIGHT) rules, Error Recovery scenarios, and all
code/report templates. These remain authoritative — they are relocated, not deleted, and every
reference file is named by a pointer in SKILL.md so nothing becomes undiscoverable.

Gold-standard lean examples: `skills/team/qraspi-skeleton/SKILL.md` (phase driver) and
`skills/team/cargo-package-scaffold/SKILL.md` (domain scaffolder with `references/` depth).

### References Directory

Each `references/` directory contains 2-5 supporting files: code examples, decision matrices, checklists, configuration templates.

## Agent Conventions

Agents exist in two flavors with identical behavior but different formats:

### Claude Code (`claude/agents/<name>.md`)

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: What the agent does
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep
model: inherit
skills:
  - skill-name-1
  - skill-name-2
---
```

### OpenCode (`opencode/agents/<name>.md`)

```yaml
---
description: What the agent does
mode: subagent
tools:
  read: true
  edit: true
  write: true
  bash: true
  glob: true
  grep: true
---
```

Key difference: Claude uses `skills:` array in frontmatter; OpenCode uses `skill({ name: "..." })` calls in the body.

### 10 Mandatory Agent Sections (in order)

1. Title + Epigraph
2. Core Philosophy
3. Guardrails
4. Autonomous Protocol
5. Self-Check Loops
6. Error Recovery
7. AI Discipline Rules
8. Session Template
9. State Block (unique XML tag per agent, e.g., `<tdd-state>`, `<code-review-state>`)
10. Completion Criteria

## Editing Guidelines

- Follow the 5-section lean layout when creating or modifying skills; push depth to `references/`.
- Keep both `claude/agents/` and `opencode/agents/` versions in sync.
- Every skill must have a `references/` directory with at least 2 supporting files.
- State block XML tags must be unique across all skills and agents.
- Frontmatter `description` fields must include trigger phrases for slash-command discovery.
- In Python code examples, avoid PyTorch evaluation mode calls that trigger security hooks. Use `model.train(False)` instead.
- **`claude/global/` and `opencode/global/` files are public templates distributed to any user.** Never embed specific book titles, personal document names, personal file paths, or user-specific tool names in these files. Collection descriptions must describe topic domains (e.g., "Rust language: ownership, async, Tokio"), not the specific documents a particular user has ingested. Installed files (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`) may contain personal references; the source template files must not.

## Skill Suites

| Suite | Skills | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| TDD | tdd (the canonical loop) + tdd-agent (autonomous operating mode) + evaluate-tests (quality & compliance audit) | Test-Driven Development lifecycle |
| Enterprise .NET | dotnet-vertical-slice, ef-migration-manager, nuget-package-scaffold, legacy-migration-analyzer, dotnet-architecture-checklist, dotnet-controller-api-scaffolder, dotnet-security-review, minimal-api-scaffolder, 4d-schema-migration | .NET patterns, migrations, security |
| Security (cross-language) | security-review-federal, oss-vetting | Shared language-agnostic federal/gov work. `security-review-federal` is the overlay (NIST 800-53, FIPS, CUI, POA&M, EO 14028, DOE 205.1B) applied on top of any base `<lang>-security-review`; `oss-vetting` produces a structured OSS/SBOM assessment for federal contractor environments (LANL/DOE/CUI) — security posture, supply chain risk, license compliance, CUI suitability against four governing frameworks; Confluence-ready report. |
| Coaching | architecture-review, pattern-tradeoff-analyzer, system-design-kata, dependency-mapper, code-review-coach, refactor-challenger, security-review-trainer, pr-feedback-writer, technical-debt-assessor, architecture-journal, grill-me, zoom-out, improve-codebase-architecture | Engineering judgment and communication modes |
| DDD | domain-model | Domain-Driven Design vocabulary and modeling |
| Product & GitHub | to-prd, to-issues, triage-issue | PRD creation, issue decomposition, bug triage |
| Agent Support | automated-code-review, test-scaffold, doc-sync, supply-chain-audit, environment-health, research-synthesis, session-context, task-decomposition | Domain knowledge for agents |
| Agent Design | spec-coach | Interactive spec design coach — skills, agents, PRDs, and GitHub Spec Kit |
| QRSPI Workflow | qrspi-questions, qrspi-research, qrspi-spec, qrspi-plan, qrspi-implement | Questions-Research-Spec-Plan-Implement: instruction-budget-disciplined replacement for RPI. No-magic-words artifact gates, ticket-hidden research, Design Brain-Dump → Structure Outline, vertical-slice plans, per-slice Red-Green-Refactor. Driven by the `qrspi-orchestrator` (alignment) + `qrspi-implement` (execution) agents and the renamed `research-*` read-only subagents. For an EXISTING codebase / adding a feature. |
| QRASPI Workflow | fitness-functions, qraspi-questions, qraspi-research, qraspi-architecture, qraspi-skeleton, qraspi-plan, qraspi-implement, qraspi-graduate | Questions-Research-Architecture-Skeleton-Plan-Implement for a NEW system (greenfield V0/V1), then graduation to QRSPI. Locks path-dependent decisions as MADR ADRs with alternatives + Mermaid C4, lands a runnable walking skeleton with fitness functions as merge-blocking CI gates (CI-green exit gate), grows it slice-by-slice with Red-Green-Refactor, then hands off to QRSPI. Driven by `qraspi-orchestrator` (no-edit Q/R/A/P/graduate) + `qraspi-builder` (edit Skeleton/Implement); `fitness-functions` is the one extracted primitive. For a NEW system from scratch — the greenfield counterpart to QRSPI. |
| Python | python-architecture-checklist, python-security-review, python-feature-slice, alembic-migration-manager, python-modernization-analyzer, fastapi-scaffolder, pypi-package-scaffold | Python patterns, migrations, security, packaging |

| Knowledge Management (PARA) | para-file, para-review | The PARA method (Tiago Forte) applied to documents across local folders, OneDrive/Teams synced paths, and Confluence/Jira. `para-file` captures/classifies/files one item by actionability (scaffolding the P/A/R/Archive tree if missing); `para-review` runs the hygiene audit + weekly ritual + summarization + safe reversible archiving. Share a per-project `.para.yml`. User-invocable via `/para-file` and `/para-review`. No agents. |
| Other | jira-review, jira-comment-writer, confluence-guide-writer | Language/tool-specific reviews and documentation generation |
